<h3 align="center">
ELIT Shared Calenda allows teleworkers and employees of ELIT frequently in
moving to stay connected to your business. It provides a centralized means of
set up meetings and projects. A group calendar can be
accessed 24/7 from any internet-connected device. The Chiefs
projects, consultants, vendors and other employees can access the
their team's schedule when they are out of the office visiting
customers or deal with other matters. They can use the group calendar
to track meetings, conference calls and project deadlines.
Not only can employees view their own schedules, but they
can also get an overview of their colleagues' calendars.

# Technical Details
This application is web-based, For all the front-end components, [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) is used and the player is completely HTML5-based. The application is essentially split into Grails for a REST-API, and ReactJs for the frontend.

Popcorn uses the [awesome API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) from [theMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org) for all media-metadata.

# Roadmap
Popcorn is still very much a work-in-progress. We will be adding new features and bug-fixes often, but this is a hobby project for the core-contributors, so the time that we can spend on it is limited.

For all our feature and bug tracking, we use the [Issues Section](https://github.com/AzouKr/Movie-Streaming-Site/issues). Popcorn's 'roadmap' is currently to work through the feature requests and improvements that are in the issue tracker.  Take a look at the milestones for what we intend to add for upcoming releases.
